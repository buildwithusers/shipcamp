# Shipcamp

## Requirements

Use Node 12+ (I switched to 14)

## Setup

Simple static website with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

## Commands

See `package.json`, mainly:

```
npm run serve   // local dev with auto reload
npm run build   // build, commit & push to deploy
```

## Deployment

The thing is hosted on GitHub Pages. Everything is served through the `./docs` folder (GitHub limitation, can't change the name).
